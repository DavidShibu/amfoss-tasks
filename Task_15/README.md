Problem 1
Here I intiated 3 variables to 0 and executed a while loop. One of the variable "i"
is increased by 3 and another variable b is increased by 5. The new values of
these variable are checked whether they exceed the users input value and is accumulated
in a variable. Multiples of 15 is avoided since it will cause a repetition of the
values.

Problem 2
A variable is initiated to 0 initially. An if condition is used to check whether the users
input is below 2. If it is below 2 0 is printed. Else a list is declared with 
1 and 2 as elements. Three other variable y,z,i is initialised to 1,2,0 respectively. 
A while loop is executed and the y variable is updated by adding the value of z
An if condition is used to check whether the updated value exceeds the users input.
If it satifies the condition the value is appended to the list. The same is done for the value of z.
Another while loop is executed and the elements of the list are checked whether they are 
even. If it is even they are accumulated and is printed.

Problem 3
A list is declared along with y and i initialised to 2,0. Users input is taken to x.
A while loop is executed with i is less than x. An if condition x%y == 0 is done to know whether it is a perfect divisor or not. If it is then it is added to the list else the value of y is increased by 1.
After exiting the loop the value of users input is also added to list. At last it is
sorted in reverse order and the first element is printed.

Problem 4
A while loop is intiated. The users input is reduced by 1 since we are not including it.
It is then converted to a string and reversed and stored to another variable. It is then checked
whether both of them are equal. If so then it is converted back to string and a for loop is initiated from 100 to 1000
The users input is % by i and checked whether it is equal to zero. If so then the length of string(i) is checked whether it equals the length of string(num//i)
If so the value of flag is changed to true and the loop is exited and the value is printed.

Problem 5
A variable is declared to 1. A function to calculate the greatest common divisor is declared.
A for loop starting from 1 till including users input value is initialised.The value of the variable declared earlier is updated by multiplying it by i and floor dividing by the gcd.
The value of the variable is printed at last.
