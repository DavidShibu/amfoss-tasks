The highlighted part of this task was troubleshooting. I spent lot of time for solving the errors that occured while executing the program. Finding the proper div class was challenging and exciting. It was totally a new experience for me. By doing this task I could learn more detailed functions and syntaxes of python. The knowledge I gained about web scrapping is also new to me. This task exposed me to several domains of programming.
