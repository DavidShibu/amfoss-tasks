Surfing web have become a daily routine in our life. When I built a webpage on my own the I felt really proud. I have a very small basic in HTML and CSS. But with the help of w3school website and chat gpt I was able to complete the task. The main problem that I faced during the task was with aligning the objects in the webpage especially the store page. I resolved it by using grid. I head a great fun time in playing with CSS. Tailwind CSS a website about CSS and it's syntax was very helpful in solving the tasks.
