This task was purely based on Linux commands and git hub. I could finish all the stages without much difficulty with the help of resource materials provided. The Harry Potter theme was really good and engaging. By completing this task I could also go through some portions from mathematics. The satisfaction I got when congratulations was displayed on the terminal was immense.
