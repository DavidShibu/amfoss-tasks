# INTROSPECTION
## SELF INTRO
Hey There!<br>
I'm David Shibu, from CSE core. I would like to explore deep inside the apllications and am very eager to know what happens behind these applications and build one in the future. I am also intrested in exploring different skills related to HFTs Arduino programming etc. 
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I have a little bit knowledge of application development since I created a Game using godot game engine when I was in plus two. I am very eager to learn how to build other android and windows applications and Amfoss is the best platform for me to achieve this.In addition to that I dont give up easily on tasks assigned to me and give my 100% to make it a success. So if you are looking for a man who does smart work you can recruit me into the club.
### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
For the next 6 months I will try to improve my coding skills and try to learn different languages from different platforms. I like competitive programming very much So I will also focus on that too.
### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will try my best by mentoring my juniors and by sharing my knowledge with all other members of the club and will try to raise the glory of oru club in all aspects.
### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
Most of the tasks included in this preveshan process was challenging for me. Through this I could learn more about different domains and aspects. I am sure it will be very useful for me in the long run.  I have tried my best in solving the tasks. I am attaching the status of the tasks here.
